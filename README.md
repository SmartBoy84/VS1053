# VS1053
This is just me trying to understand the VS1053. I bought it thinking it was good [value]{https://www.altronics.com.au/p/z6335-mp3-audio-module-with-microphone/} and left hating it.

To be fair, this was on me for trying to do it all with only the datasheet; I should've used a library sigh Anyway, feel free to look through my code and notes if you're on a similar endeavour, I have tried to explain everything that the datasheet/libraries generally skip over.

In all seriousness, the VS1053 module is an extremely powerful codec if one knows how to use it properly. Most libraries have only implemented the most basic features of the module and seem to skip over the rest, I hope I can turn this into a coherent documentation of all it's features (over time).

This is a PlatformIO project for the ESP32
